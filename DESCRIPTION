Description: A collection of functions related to density estimation by using Chen's (2000) idea. Mean Squared Errors (MSE) are calculated for estimated curves. For this purpose, R functions allow the distribution to be Gamma, Exponential or Weibull. For details see Chen (2000), Scaillet (2004) <doi:10.1080/10485250310001624819> and Khan and Akbar.
